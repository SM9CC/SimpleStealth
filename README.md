# Stealth Revived #

*A proper stealth plugin that actually works.
*

Stealth Revived is a plugin which aims to help server admins catch cheaters by hiding them completely when they go into spectator.

### What does the plugin currently do? ###
* Hides stealthed admins from scoreboard.
* Hides stealthed admins from status.
* Blocks cheats with "Show spectator option"

### How does it work? ###
* Simple join spectator while you have Admin Kick flag (Or you can change it using the override 'admin_stealth') and you will vanish, Now you can easily spectate cheaters and they will never know!

### Does it support games other than CSGO? ###
It does partially, but the status rewrite for games other than TF2 and CSGO is not yet supported.
